# Programmers Palace Examples
A compilation of code, articles (Wiki) and projects built by members of the Programmers Palace Discord Programming Community, often in the process of helping others learn to code! Our goal is to recognize &amp; display the work of our members, allow them to point to their contributions on their Github portfolio (including their in-server ones), have a joint community "project", and provide valuable examples for future members who need help! Let's show off what our community is all about!
