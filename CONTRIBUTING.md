# Contributing Rules
We invite anyone in our community to share their code on this repository! However, we do have some **rules** and **suggestions** that you must follow with your pull requests. 

**Please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/dkantereivin/programmers-palace-examples/issues/new) or ask for help (from staff or community members) in the Programmers Palace server.

#### What is a pull request? How do I do a pull request? Help!
On this Github repository, press the **Fork** button in the top left. This will create a copy of this repository on your Github account.
On your own repository, make any changes you want to the repository. When you are finished, press "pull request" in the top left. Make sure to follow the below rules and suggestions.

#### Contributing Articles:
Please create a [Wiki](https://github.com/dkantereivin/programmers-palace-examples/wiki) page for any articles you would like to submit.

## Rules:
1. Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dkantereivin/programmers-palace-examples/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be constructive/helpful at all times.
2. Please keep pull requests atomic. This means that you should only submit one feature/program/submission at a time.
3. Do not submit code outside of a folder. Follow the naming convention of other folders, and then submit your project inside it's own folder.
4. Please avoid advertising or self-promotion within your contributions. We will be reasonable: if it is neccessary or helpful to the overall purpose of your code, then absolutely add it; just avoid irrelevant links or advertisements of any kind.
5. Please, if you worked on this with someone else (whether they were helping you or you were helping them), give them credit if you're uploading the code!
6. By submitting code to this repository, you are relinquishing any copyrights over the code, and releasing the intellectual property into the *public domain*. This means that any code you submit will conform to this repository's [license](https://github.com/dkantereivin/programmers-palace-examples/blob/master/LICENSE).
7. Write a descriptive commit message, especially if you choose not to write a README. This is extremely important, failure to comply may result in your pull request being rejected.

## Suggestions:
1. Write up a README.md **inside your project's folder** indicating the author of the code and writing about it (see 3 and 4).
2. Clean up and comment your code before posting! Set a good example for others, and make your code more accessible to beginners who may be reviewing it!
3. Write what the purpose of this code is, and perhaps why you're writing it!
4. Explain your code! Tell us about the journey -- what does it do, how did you come to write it, what was the most challenging, and how did you overcome it? Anything that would be helpful to others is helpful, and looks great on you as the contributor!
